    "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning to find the values of model parameters that minimize the error between the predicted and actual values. It works by iteratively adjusting the parameter values in the direction of the steepest descent of the error function. The size of each adjustment is determined by the learning rate, which controls the step size of each iteration. Gradient descent is commonly used in linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and other machine learning models."

    "Multiple linear regression is a statistical model that describes the relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables. It extends simple linear regression by allowing for multiple predictors, rather than just one. The model includes a coefficient for each independent variable, which represents the change in the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change in that independent variable, while holding all other variables constant. The multiple linear regression model differs from the simple linear regression model in that it includes more than one independent variable."

It can be detected by calculating the correlation matrix between independent variables, and addressing it can be done by removing one or more of the correlated variables or by using dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis. Regularization techniques like ridge regression and lasso regression can also be used to mitigate the impact of multicollinearity."

It is different from linear regression in that it can model nonlinear relationships between the variables. While linear regression models assume a linear relationship between the variables, polynomial regression models allow for curved or nonlinear relationships. Polynomial regression can also model interactions between independent variables by including cross-terms in the polynomial equation."
