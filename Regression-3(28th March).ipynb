    "Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression model used to deal with multicollinearity (high correlation among independent variables) in the dataset. It adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares regression, which limits the magnitude of the coefficients of the independent variables, thus reducing the impact of multicollinearity on the model's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike ordinary least squares regression, where the objective is to minimize the sum of squared residuals, Ridge Regression minimizes the sum of squared residuals plus a penalty term, which is the sum of squares of the coefficients multiplied by a regularization parameter lambda. This additional penalty term shrinks the coefficients towards zero and makes the model less sensitive to the noise in the data."

    "Yes, Ridge Regression can be used for feature selection by penalizing the coefficients of the less important features, shrinking them towards zero, and effectively eliminating them from the model. This is because the penalty term in Ridge Regression depends on the magnitude of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform feature selection using Ridge Regression, we can vary the regularization parameter lambda and observe how the coefficients change. The features with small coefficients or coefficients that become zero for higher values of lambda are considered less important and can be eliminated from the model. However, it is important to note that Ridge Regression does not perform feature selection as rigorously as other methods like Lasso Regression, which has a built-in feature selection mechanism."

    "Ridge Regression is a robust regression method that performs well in the presence of multicollinearity, which is the high correlation among independent variables.

Ridge Regression overcomes this problem by adding a penalty term to the least squares estimates, which constrains the coefficients' magnitude and reduces their variance.\n",

However, categorical variables need to be converted into numerical variables before they can be included in the model.
