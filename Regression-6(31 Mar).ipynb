    "(i) Planning and designing: The first step is to define the application requirements and design its architecture, user interface, and database schema.\n",

    "(ii) Development: The next step is to develop the application using programming languages, frameworks, and libraries that are appropriate for the requirements. It includes front-end development for user interface, back-end development for server-side logic, and database development.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) Testing: Once the development is complete, testing is done to ensure that the application works as expected and meets the requirements. It includes functional testing, unit testing, integration testing, and performance testing.\n",

    "(iv) Deployment: After testing, the application is deployed on a cloud platform. The deployment process includes setting up servers, databases, and other infrastructure required for the application to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "(v) Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD): CI/CD is a development practice that involves continuous integration of code changes into the main branch of the application and continuous delivery of updates to the production environment. It helps ensure that the application is always up-to-date and bug-free.\n",
    "\n",
    "(vi) Monitoring and scaling: Once the application is deployed, it needs to be monitored to ensure that it is running smoothly. If there are any issues, they need to be resolved quickly. As the application grows, it may need to be scaled horizontally or vertically to handle the increased load."

    "Traditional web hosting relies on a single physical server to host websites or web applications, while cloud hosting uses a distributed network of servers. Cloud hosting offers greater scalability, flexibility, and reliability, as resources can be easily scaled up or down based on demand. Additionally, cloud hosting typically offers better security features and uptime guarantees than traditional web hosting. However, traditional web hosting may be more cost-effective for smaller websites or those with lower traffic volumes."

Additionally, various cloud-based services, such as Google Cloud ML Engine or AWS SageMaker, can be used to deploy the machine learning model and make it accessible via an API."
